## **Goals**

- Aggregate weather data from public sources
- Allow users to plan tasks based on the data
  - Filter an activity based on weather conditions
    - "I only want to run when it isn't raining and humidity is less than 50%"
  - Provide tasks that are generally enjoyable given a forecast
    - Today would be perfect for: picking mushrooms and spotting this rare bird {bird}
    - More detailed lists would be better, though
      - "{mushroom} is likely to be found in your area around {coordinates} today"
      - This is an optimum day to plant Lillies!
### **Stretch Goals**
- Host a database, allowing users to send local weather station data and/or task suggestions
  - Task suggestions would need a TON of monitoring
